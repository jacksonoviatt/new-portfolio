        <p>Iâ€™m a full stack web developer based out of Edmonton, Canada. I love creating beautiful front-end and stable back-end work with a special eye towards aesthetic and visual design. I pride myself on the ability to fine-tune my work down to the last line and always try to exceed expectations. I love diving into new situations, concepts, and projects with both feet.</p>
        <p>I am always eager to learn more and engage with others as I expand my abilities. My dad is a web developer and raised me around code and tech, so I am thrilled to be joining him in the industry. </p>
        <p>I currently live with my partner Harley, my rescue dog Tuco, and my one-eared cat Duck. In my spare time, I enjoy studying paleontology and natural history. I also like to forage for mushrooms and local flora.</p>
